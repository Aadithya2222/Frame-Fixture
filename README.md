## Project Challenge

Indian artisans and craftsmen, rich in traditional skills and cultural heritage, often face challenges in the modern digital marketplace:

- Lack of digital marketing skills
- Limited resources
- Difficulty bridging traditional craftsmanship with contemporary consumer trends

This creates a disconnect between valuable traditional art forms and digitally-native audiences, threatening the sustainability of these crafts.

---

## Project Objective

Develop a creative solution leveraging Google Cloud's generative AI to:

- Enhance artisans’ digital presence
- Improve marketing and sales strategies
- Help artisans effectively tell the story of their craft

The solution should harmonize traditional craftsmanship with modern preferences, expand market access, and secure the future of these unique art forms.
